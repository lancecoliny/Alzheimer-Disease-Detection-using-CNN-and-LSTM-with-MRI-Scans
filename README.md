# Alzheimer-Disease-Detection-using-CNN-and-LSTM-with-MRI-Scans
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by severe memory loss and cognitive impairment, accompanied by significant brain structure changes detectable through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. These preclinical structural changes offer an opportunity for early AD detection using image classification tools such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. However, many current studies face limitations due to small sample sizes, making efficient training methods for image classifiers on limited data crucial. In our project, we explored various learning methods based on CNN and LSTM for predicting AD using brain MRI images. CNNs are particularly effective in extracting spatial features from images, while LSTMs excel in handling sequential data, which is beneficial for capturing temporal dependencies in medical imaging. By combining these two approaches, we aimed to enhance the accuracy and robustness of AD detection.Our study found that both CNN and LSTM significantly improved prediction performance compared to a deep CNN trained from scratch. The CNN model alone demonstrated substantial improvements, leveraging its ability to learn hierarchical features from MRI scans. Meanwhile, the LSTM network further enhanced the model's capability by incorporating temporal information, thus providing a more comprehensive analysis of brain structure changes over time.Moreover, the integration of CNN and LSTM resulted in even better performance, achieving a prediction accuracy of 95%.
